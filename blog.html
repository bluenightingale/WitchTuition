                <p>Sorry for this one taking awhile, I didnt mean for it to take this long to finish the portraits. But a mix of art block and not feeling as any of it is adiquate enough. But reaction portraits for the current Hero Customers are here!</p>
                <img src="Images/devlog3IMG/cherie examples.png">
                <p>Like to me these are 3 different but I wont mull about it outside of this, it just hard to stay consistent for 9 portraits AND be saitsfied with it</p>
                <p>Now's priority is scripting for the next devlog and I already got a good summary on what to say, it'll be more of a recounting of what ive done cause Ive got to get going and lock out of the monotony of my day job.
                    I might in the future shade and highlight the portraits too so not final product of course! I also need to figure out how to record my voice better, I used audacity but idk if thats really working out in my strongsuit.
                </p>
                <p>Either way ill figure it out in time! It'll probably be shortish like the last one. I have to B line to making the 3rd pillar Foraging so i'll do my best</p>

                <i style="font-size: 0.8rem; margin-bottom: 0.2rem;">August 24 - September 2, 2024</i>
                <br>
                <img src="Images/devlog3IMG/herospawnexample.gif">
                <p>After opening the shop, you have a chance to spawn hero’s in your shop that won’t reset till the next time you open back up. For now they pick a random spot within the cabin area to stand.</p>
                <p>This week was making UI, heros to spawn on a rarity, filter duplicates so you shouldnt get a hero your already doing an order for, and their skeletons. After this, I just have to make them dialog sprites & preferences </p>
                <p>Ive had an inkling to give them like one of those gatcha intros when the doors open and the star rating and <b>BIG</b> fullbody portrait. Nothing too much like an animated intro, its just to get the ground
                    off it.
                </p>
                <p>Plus I still need to make each of the current hero's (3) portraits, (alot of the game progress is needing art argh) Next blog post should be the last one before I start working on the 4th devlog ᕦ(ò_óˇ)ᕤ</p>
                <p style="font-size: 1.8rem; margin-bottom: 0px;">Goals Left:</p>
                <ul style="font-size: 1.3rem; margin-top: 0px;">
                    <li>Hero Preferences (only wanting healing/defense/etc)</li>
                    <li>Hero Portraits</li>
                    <li>Decor Rep Multiply</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="font-size: 1.8rem; margin-bottom: 0px;">---Sept 2nd Edit---</p>
                <p>I SEVERLY underestimated how much I would be saitsfied making portraits for these, not to mention my motivation for doing art have crashed for awhile after doing it daily, but I wont whine about it RN</p>
                <p>Portraits are still in the works, still 9 needed, maybe I shouldnt hold off making blog posts cause the sole reason of these was to share WIP faster but yea. It might be awhile to make sure they arent like weird looking.</p>

                <p>redid the inventory almost entirely to compensate the new design this weekend & added in Rael + Cherie.
                    I was working on this UI on and off abit during my dayjob, (work wasnt that extensive) and got to work this weekend
                    with coding for it so i can replace the wip stand in it had before.
                </p>
                <p>moreso entered the train of "well if i did this i might aswell add this, so now its fully redeveloped lol.
                    as always it still depends on other factors so ill say its 90% done (•̀ᴗ•́)و ̑̑</p>
                <p>Also added 2 new heros to fill in the Hero Star Lists for future testing </p>
                <p><i class="fa fa-star"></i> 2 Star Magical Girl Hero Cherie (Water Hybrid one)</p>
                <p><i class="fa fa-star"></i> 3 Star Ex-Pirate Turned Mercenary Hero Rael (Elf one)</p>
                <img src="Images/devlog3IMG/Rael & Cherie.png">
                <p>Fun Fact: Rael is my first and current running DnD PC :D!!</p>
                <p>making these npc models is alot of fun and i can get them out pretty quick surprisingly, more annoying to put
                    together tho since they all have stuff on them so they dont scale similarly. One day ill get fed up and put them all through a grinder.
                </p>
                <p>but for now screw future me, ima have fun with them. Now back to the rest of that list!</p>

                    Ive been working on this list since July. The results tracker is there but I feel like it needs abit more tweaking before its ok.
                </p>
                <p>I also stated awhile ago (somewhere) that once the 4.3 update changes come to godot ill try to get on track for a art overhaul. Ive kinda already been trying to 
                    since ive been making UI recently, Ill let you guys know about its progress after this devlog but yea again ill tackle it periodically so my wrists dont fall off!
                </p>
                <p>These last ones shouldnt be too much trouble tho! Ive already implemented the heros having a rarity spawn, i just have to call them after the shop gets closed.
                    Otherwise ill do my best to not have this devlog take more than a month to post lol!

                <p>Hello Visitors!</p>
                <p>I made this website to better track the development progress in my game Witch Tuition!</p>
                <p>Ive never made a website before so ill still try to update the look of this place while adding new posts and progresses.
                    Twitter and youtube only felt like the places I COULD post updates on, but I share more updates casually that would take forever to keep up with devlogs for.
                    The hosting site might change too if I need to like add comments or more storage but ill be figuring it out! 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hope you can keep this site in mind and take a peak when updates come! ill try to also get past updates when im free to for archiving!
                    Until then, I hope you guys stick around! :D

                <p>The classes ranges from Commoners | Travelers | Adventurers | Nobles</p>
                <p>There will also be Heros: who will request commissions of multiple potions as well as have ratity when spawned in. I sorta also wonder if theres gonna be too many skeleton bases in the final version.</p>
